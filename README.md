# lti-exploration

This is a super simple environment to experiment with making your LTI.

Start by running `docker-compose up` to bring up the environment.  Then connect to localhost:3000 and login with `canvas@example.edu`, password `canvas-docker`. 

The XML for the LTI is `http://web.local/sample.xml`.
